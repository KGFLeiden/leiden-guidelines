# A. Videos

### Definition

The international courts and tribunals do not define the concept of videos. However, in general terms, video recordings are commonly referred to as 'audio-visual material'.[^4] More specifically, videos can be defined as 'visual multimedia source[s] through which a series of images forms a moving picture. The video transmits a signal to a screen and processes the order in which the screen captures should be shown. Videos usually have audio components that correspond with the pictures being shown on the screen.'[^5]

### Guideline A1. Instead of excerpts, videos should be submitted in their entirety.

!!! note "KEYWORDS"
    PROCEDURE

Submission of full videos, transcripts, and translations assist the Court in contextualising the portions of the video identified by the party seeking admission as being most relevant.[^6] The Trial Chamber in *Ntaganda* admitted a video broadcast which provided context to the security situation in its entirety, instead of only the excerpts submitted by the Defence: 'From time stamps 22:57 to 23:38; 24:02 to 24:29; 25:55 to 27:42; 29:54 to 30:18; 32:40 to 33:05; 36:58 to 39:01; and 47:35 to 48:46'.[^7]

**Excerpts.** If a party nevertheless seeks to tender excerpts, the tendering party should also clearly indicate whether the full footage was available and who extracted the portions of the video.[^8] The opposing party may tender additional excerpts to assist the Court in contextualising the portions sought to be admitted.[^9] The Trial Chamber in *Ntaganda* granted the Prosecution's request to admit extensions of video excerpts tendered that illustrated the reason for the presence of community leaders at an event depicted in the video excerpts.[^10]

### Guideline A2. A video and associated transcripts and translations must be seen as forming integral parts of the same evidence.

!!! note "KEYWORDS"
    PROCEDURE, TRANSCRIPTS, TRANSLATION

The documents are written records designed to faithfully reflect the contents of the video for better comprehension.[^11] Consequently, each part is treated as parts of the same evidence. For example, the formal submission of a video automatically includes recognising the formal submission of associated transcripts and translations which were duly disclosed.[^12] Similarly, it would be incoherent to impose restrictions on one part but not the others.[^13] The Trial Chamber in *Katanga and Ngudjolo Chui* granted a request to apply the same protective measures to the transcript and translation of a video as it was authorised to apply to the video itself.[^14] To facilitate the presentation of the evidence in court, the tendering party should indicate the portions of the video, transcript, and translation which it intends to use.[^15] The parties should also consult and resolve any disagreements about the transcripts or translations.[^16]

### Guideline A3. Videos not in a working language of the Court should be translated into one of the working languages of the Court and made available to the Chamber and all parties within the time limit fixed by the Chamber.

!!! note "KEYWORDS"
    PROCEDURE, TRANSLATION

**Translation.** Pursuant to Regulation 39(1) of the [Regulations of the Court](https://www.icc-cpi.int/Publications/Regulations-of-the-Court.pdf), all documents and materials filed with the Registry shall be in a working language of the Court. If portions of the video are not in a working language of the Court, those portions must be translated into a working language of the Court before they can be deemed admissible.[^17] The Prosecution has not complied with its disclosure obligations under Rule 77 of the [ICC Rules of Procedure and Evidence](https://www.icc-cpi.int/Publications/Rules-of-Procedure-and-Evidence.pdf) until the translations have been provided to the Defence.[^18] The translation requirement is based on the accused person's right to be informed of the evidence on which the Prosecution intends to rely on and of the nature, cause and content of the charge.[^19] Moreover, the Chamber must be in a position to fully understand the evidence which the parties intend to rely upon.[^20]

**Time Limits.** Pursuant to Regulation 34 of the [Regulations of the Court](https://www.icc-cpi.int/Publications/Regulations-of-the-Court.pdf), the translations should be submitted by the time limit fixed by the Chamber in order to be deemed admissible. Nonetheless, the interest of the Court in receiving the transcripts and translations after the time limit in order to understand the original videos may outweigh their late submission.[^21] Limited resources and labour-intensiveness can constitute 'good cause' for the extension of a time limit under the first part of Regulation 35(2) of the [Regulations of the Court](https://www.icc-cpi.int/Publications/Regulations-of-the-Court.pdf). However, after the lapse of a time limit, the fact that transcription and translation is time consuming is not considered an exceptional circumstance for an extension of the time limit under the second part of Regulation 35(2).[^22] A video may be disclosed after the time limit to substitute the portions that overlap with a previously disclosed video if it is of superior quality. However, the Court may not admit the additional material that does not overlap if the party does not justify late disclosure under Regulation 35(2).[^23]

**Translation by Counsel.** Videos brought in from other sources and devoid of translation and transcription can be translated and transcribed by counsel, so long as it is done with accuracy and the material is presented for translation afterwards.[^24] The Trial Chamber in *Mladić* allowed the Defence to transcribe and translate a video of two film crews visiting a humanitarian refugee centre.[^25]

### Guideline A4. When a witness appears on a video that the party intends to tender into evidence, the video should be tendered through the witness during the examination-in-chief and not through the bar table.

!!! note "KEYWORDS"
    PROCEDURE

It is more appropriate for videos to be tendered during the examination-in-chief of the witnesses who appear on the videos. If a party wishes to present a video to a witness, it must first establish that the witness has personal knowledge of the making of the recording or its contents by playing a brief excerpt of the video to the extent strictly necessary for the witness to confirm their personal knowledge of it.[^26] The video will not be considered for the truth of its contents unless it is admitted into evidence, even if the video was presented to the witness.[^27] With consideration for the length of the videos and the procedure for having videos admitted through witnesses, the Court may grant additional time for the examination-in-chief of the witnesses.[^28] The Trial Chamber in *Ntaganda* granted a Defence request for an additional 15 minutes for the examination-in-chief of two witnesses so that the video could be tendered through them.[^29]

### Guideline A5. Evidence must be provided regarding the date and/or location of video material.

!!! note "KEYWORDS"
    RELEVANCE, DISCLOSURE

The relevance of video material depends on the date, time, and/or location of recording.[^30] Thus, the date, time, and location of the recording must be indicated as precisely as possible. A video is only disclosed from the moment the Defence can fully understand what its precise content is. It will only be possible for the Defence to fully understand the contents of a video after these details have been indicated.[^31] Investigative techniques can be employed to identify these details.[^32]

### Guideline A6. The Court can make an inference from the content of a video to the extent that it allows the Court to make a definite finding.

!!! note "KEYWORDS"
    RELEVANCE

Caution should be exercised when considering a video since differences in personal perception can cause difficulties in making a definite finding.[^33] It may not be possible to make a definite finding if a subject appears too briefly in the video.[^34] The Trial Chamber in *Lubanga* was not able to make a definite finding on the depiction of alleged child soldiers in a video where children who could be under the age of 15 appeared for just two seconds in a video.[^35] However, allowing for a wide margin of error, it is possible to make definite findings. The Court will rely on the video only to the extent that it can make a definite finding.[^36] The Trial Chamber in *Lubanga* relied on video evidence concerning child soldiers only to the extent that it could make a definite finding that it depicted children who were clearly under the age of 15.[^37] A negative finding based on what was not shown in the video can in principle be made.[^38] Pursuant to Rule 63(4) of the Rules of Procedure and Evidence, there is no strict legal requirement that the video has to be corroborated by other evidence for the Court to be able to rely on it and establish a specific fact.[^39] The Appeals Chamber in *Lubanga* affirmed that it was not unreasonable for the Trial Chamber to reach conclusions on the age of individuals based on the video evidence in the absence of any corroborating evidence.[^40]

### Guideline A7.

[...]

### Guideline A8. Video evidence of interviews conducted during an armed conflict by a party to the conflict may not be objective and reliable and therefore low probative value may be attached to the video.

!!! note "KEYWORDS"
    PROBATIVE VALUE

This Guideline refers to interviews conducted by, not with, a party to the conflict. Interviewees' statements taken by a party to the conflict in an armed conflict may be driven by fear, even if there is no other evidence of intimidation or coercion.[^41] The Pre-Trial Chamber in *Bemba* attached low probative value to an interview that was produced by the Movement for the Liberation of the Congo (MLC) at a time when the Central African Republic had still been under attack and the MLC had been a party to the conflict.[^42] The consideration of the objectivity and reliability of the interviewee would apply equally to interviews tendered by the Prosecution.

### Guideline A9. The consent of witnesses and others affected by the work of the Court whose image is depicted in video evidence is required.

!!! note "KEYWORDS"
    PREJUDICE, PRIVACY, CONSENT

Pursuant to Article 68(1) of the [Rome Statute](https://www.icc-cpi.int/Publications/Rome-Statute.pdf), the Court shall take appropriate measures to protect the safety, physical and psychological well-being, dignity and privacy of victims and witnesses. Circulation of an individual's image without consent from the individual may constitute a violation of the right to privacy or private life.[^43] Prior to the disclosure of the evidence, the individuals concerned should be consulted, if possible, to ensure that no unaddressed issues, for example security risks, occur.[^44] A high degree of care should be taken to not unnecessarily link individuals with the Court: evidence which depicts an individual's image should only be used when no acceptable alternative investigative approach is available.[^45] However, once the evidence has been disclosed pursuant to Article 67(2) of the [Rome Statute](https://www.icc-cpi.int/Publications/Rome-Statute.pdf) or Rules 76 or 77 of the [ICC Rules of Procedure and Evidence](https://www.icc-cpi.int/Publications/Rules-of-Procedure-and-Evidence.pdf), a party or participant does not have to make a discrete application in advance whenever the evidence is to be shown during investigations.[^46]

The Defence challenged the video presented by the Prosecution, on the basis of it not including scenes that were very important for the accused person.
