# F. Audio Recordings

### Guideline F1. Instead of excerpts, audio recordings should be submitted in their entirety.

!!! note "KEYWORDS"
    PROCEDURE, EXCERPTS

Submission of full recordings, transcripts, and translations assist judges in contextualising the portions of the recording identified by the party seeking admission as being most relevant.[^258] The Trial Chamber in *Bemba* refused to admit the audio recording of a monologue attributed to the Secretary-General of the Movement for the Liberation of the Congo because '[t]he recording is clearly an excerpt and not a full interview or even a full answer to a question on a relevant matter in this case'.[^259]

**Excerpts.** If a party nevertheless seeks to tender excerpts, additional excerpts may be tendered to assist judges in contextualising the portions sought to be admitted. The Trial Chamber in *Bemba* held that an excerpt of a Radio France Internationale (RFI) broadcast could be admitted only if the Trial Chamber were 'provided with sufficient information in order to verify this brief excerpt actually emanates from RFI or one of its reports or correspondents'.[^260]

### Guideline F2. Audio recordings of media broadcasts are relevant if they refer to events that took place during the time period relevant to the charges and are contemporaneous with the events.

    RELEVANCE, MEDIA BROADCASTS

Audio recordings of media broadcasts should be contemporaneous to the events they purport to detail. The Trial Chamber in *Bemba* found that audio recording CAR-OTP-0031-0099 (a Radio France Internationale programme concerning the situation in the Central African Republic (CAR) dated 5 December 2002) was relevant to the case as it referred 'to events that allegedly took place in the CAR during the time period relevant to the charges' and it was contemporaneous with the events.[^261]

### Guideline F3. Portions of audio recordings containing opinion evidence are not admissible.

!!! note "KEYWORDS"
    RELEVANCE, OPINION EVIDENCE

Portions of an audio recording containing opinion evidence are not admissible, although the remainder of the information in the recording may nevertheless be found relevant. The SCSL in Taylor partially admitted Clip 14 (an audio recording of a BBC interview with a reporter about 3000 Sierra Leonean refugees fleeing from the northern regions of Sierra Leone) and excluded the portions consisting of the reporter’s own opinion rather than facts.[^262]

### Guideline F6. Audio recordings containing the accounts of persons interviewed may be used on a case-by-case basis to corroborate other evidence.

!!! note "KEYWORDS"
    RELEVANCE, PREJUDICE, CORROBORATION

Audio recordings of a radio programme containing the accounts of persons interviewed may be considered for limited purposes, to be determined on a case-by-case basis. The Trial Chamber in *Bemba* held that recording CAR-OTP-0031-0099 (a Radio France Internationale programme concerning the situation in the Central African Republic dated 5 December 2002) could 'serve to corroborate other pieces of evidence and might be examined when assessing the prosecution's allegation that the conduct described in the charges was widely broadcast which, according to the prosecution, may have implications with regard to the accused's alleged knowledge of the crimes charged.'[^274] In light of the envisioned limited usage of the information contained in the recording, the Trial Chamber was of the view that there was no reason to believe that the admission of this recording would have a prejudicial effect on a fair trial, and admitted it into evidence.[^275] Similarly, the Trial Chamber found that recording CAR-OTP-0031-0104 (an audio recording of four tracks of a news programme and one interview) could also be admitted for the limited purpose of corroborating 'other pieces of evidence'.[^276]

The following portions constituted opinion evidence: ‘(i) when speaking of refugees being taken to clinics, the report (Cillah) says “I mean, where they’re giving treatment and sustain treatment just to get them relaxed and refreshed;” (ii) when reporting of the abduction of a number of young men and women, Cillah ventures this opinion: “I mean these obviously are going to be retrained to fight on the side of the rebels;” (iii) speaking of people killed in the attacks, Cillah says “it would appear that particularly in Port Loko, these rebels, they targeted senior functionaries of government or otherwise senior supporters of the ruling SLPP party;” (iv) answering a question about people fleeing into Guinea from Sierra Leone, Cillah says “it would appear that these refugees are now stopping at the last Sierra Leonean town of Kambia and adopting a wait-and-see attitude as to whether they should come into Guinean territory or go back to their homes”.’
