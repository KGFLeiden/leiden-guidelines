# B. Photographs

### Definition

Photographs are widely used within international criminal proceedings, but despite their common usage, courts and tribunals have not undertaken to provide a definition at this stage. Photographs often fall under the broad definition of documentary evidence which includes 'anything in which information of any description is recorded'[^70] and can be defined as 'picture[s] made using a camera, in which an image is focused on to light-sensitive material and then made visible and permanent by chemical treatment, or stored digitally'.[^71]

### Guideline B1. The Court can make an inference from the content of a photograph to the extent that it allows the Court to make a definite finding.

The Court spoke on videos, but this applies to photographs as well: Caution should be exercised when considering a photograph since differences in personal perception can cause difficulties in making a definite finding.[^72] The Court will rely on the photograph only to the extent that it can make such a definite finding.[^73] The Trial Chamber in *Lubanga* established that a reliable distinction can be drawn between individuals of different age ranges, based solely on the individuals' appearance.[^74] Pursuant to Rule 63(4) of the [ICC Rules of Procedure and Evidence](https://www.icc-cpi.int/iccdocs/pids/legal-texts/rulesprocedureevidenceeng.pdf), there is no strict legal requirement that a photograph has to be corroborated by other evidence for the Court to be able to rely on it and establish a specific fact.[^75]

### Guideline B2. In order to determine their relevance and probative value, photographs should be accompanied by reliable information regarding their date, location and events depicted.

    RELEVANCE, PROBATIVE VALUE

Based on Article 69(4) of the [Rome Statute](https://www.icc-cpi.int/resource-library/documents/rs-eng.pdf) and Rules 63 and 64 of the [ICC Rules of Procedure and Evidence](https://www.icc-cpi.int/iccdocs/pids/legal-texts/rulesprocedureevidenceeng.pdf), regarding the Court's power to rule on the relevance, probative value and admissibility of any evidence, photographs should be accompanied by reliable information on their date, location and events depicted. If the Court does not receive such information, photographs' relevance to issues of the case and probative value cannot be determined.[^76] Further, the Trial Chamber in *Ntaganda* noted that since six photographs brought by the Prosecution were not dated, their relevance and probative value surrounding issues of the case could not be determined.[^77] It added that when photographs are dated, the parties seeking admission should provide evidence from which the Court can conclude that the dates are correct and fall within the temporal scope of the charges.[^78] The Trial Chamber in *Ntaganda* also noted that certain dated photographs could have some relevance, including photos dated ambiguously ('08/07 2003') or by a range ('January-February 2003'), but in the absence of any further reliable information as to the date, location and events depicted in the photographs, it could not admit them into evidence due to lack of probative value.[^79]

Likewise, the Trial Chamber in *Karamera* found that a photographic piece of evidence did not have sufficient indicia of authenticity as it did not contain any reliable information, including but not limited to no official stamp, signature, seal, date, no corroborating evidence, no indication of the chain of custody and/or author. The Trial Chamber thus found the origin of the photograph doubtful.[^80] The Trial Chamber in *Bemba* also discussed this when considering two photographs, stating that since the Prosecution had not provided 'any information or evidence to support their authenticity and reliability', their probative value was 'outweighed by their potential unfair prejudice to a fair trial'.[^81]

### Guideline B3. The content of photographs can be corroborated by witnesses present at the moment they were taken.

Where there is poor quality of photographs, it is unclear who took them and/or how they were developed, consistent testimonies from credible witnesses who were at the site can corroborate the content of the photographs.[^82] The Trial Chamber in *Ntaganda* noted the consistent evidence of photographs taken from credible witnesses, and the consistent testimony from seven witnesses, to satisfy itself that the photographs indeed depicted the aftermath of a massacre.[^83]

### Guideline B5. The consent of witnesses and others affected by the work of the Court whose image is depicted in photographic evidence is required.

    PREJUDICE, PRIVACY, CONSENT

Pursuant to Article 68(1) of the [Rome Statute](https://www.icc-cpi.int/resource-library/documents/rs-eng.pdf), the Court shall take appropriate measures to protect the safety, physical and psychological well-being, dignity and privacy of victims and witnesses. Circulation of photographs of witnesses and others affected by the work of the Court without consent from the individuals may constitute a violation of the right to privacy or private life.[^90] Prior to disclosure of the photographs, the individuals concerned should be consulted, if possible, to ensure that no unaddressed issues, for example security risks, occur.[^91] However, once a photograph has been disclosed pursuant to Article 67(2) of the [Rome Statute](https://www.icc-cpi.int/resource-library/documents/rs-eng.pdf) or Rules 76 or 77 of the [ICC Rules of Procedure and Evidence](https://www.icc-cpi.int/iccdocs/pids/legal-texts/rulesprocedureevidenceeng.pdf), a party or participant does not have to make a discrete application in advance whenever the photograph is to be shown during investigations.[^92] The Trial Chamber in *Bemba* determined that doing so would render the investigation ineffective.[^93] Nevertheless, a very high degree of care should be taken to not unnecessarily link individuals in the photograph with the Court.[^94] Such photographs should only be used when no acceptable alternative investigative approach is available.[^95]
