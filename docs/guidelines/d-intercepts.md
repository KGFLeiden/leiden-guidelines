# D. Intercepts

### Guideline D3. Reliability and authenticity of intercepts may be amplified by the weight of other corroborative evidence.

    RELEVANCE, PROBATIVE VALUE

Pursuant to Rule 89(C) of the [ICTY Rules of Procedure and Evidence](https://www.icty.org/x/file/Legal%20Library/Rules_procedure_evidence/IT032Rev50_en.pdf), intercepts have a high degree of validity regarding the conversations recorded due to weight of other evidence to support the reliability and authenticity of the intercepts.[^143] The Trial Chamber in *Tolimir* held, concerning intercepted radio communications, that independent corroboration and overwhelming weight of other evidence may facilitate the admission of intercepts and support their reliability and authenticity.[^144]

  **Internal Means of Corroboration.** Intercepts are more likely to be deemed reliable by a Court when it can be authenticated, cross checked and corroborated through internal means such as multiple operators intercepting the same message.[^145] The authenticity and reliability of the communication is supported by the fact that two or more intercept operators have monitored the same conversation, with only slight or no variations from each other.[^146] This also applies when operators work from different locations.[^147] The Trial Chamber found this to be the case in two separate occasions, *Krstić* and *Blagojević and Jokić,* when single conversations were monitored by different intercept operators from different locations.[^148] Consequently, where corroborating evidence is of a high level of documentable detail that could not have been completely manufactured it is more likely the intercept evidence will be accepted as reliable.

  **Forensic Reports.** An intercept whose authenticity cannot be confirmed with certainty may nevertheless be admitted if a forensic report states that there are no traces of it having been tampered with.[^149] The Trial Chamber in Zupljanin found that, while a forensic report analysing the telephone intercept of a conversation had clearly said that its authenticity could not be confirmed with any degree of full certainty, the report did observe that there were no traces of it having been tampered with. Once the witness confirmed that it was his voice on the intercept and that he was speaking to the accused, the intercept could be admitted.[^150]

  **Ambiguous and/or Cryptic Content.** Where the relevance of several intercepts, considered individually, is questionable on the basis of their ambiguous and/or cryptic content, the Trial Chamber may nevertheless take a comprehensive approach and admit them: in *Mladić*, it found that the intercepts related to the Srebrenica segment of the Prosecution's case, some of which were ambiguous on their own, constituted a contemporaneous, chronological record of events on the ground and demonstrated a network of interaction and exchange of information concerning the alleged crimes charged in the Indictment.[^151] As a result, they were relevant. However, the weight the Chamber will ultimately attribute to every individual intercept it admits into evidence can only fully be assessed following further contextualization by witnesses who were either participants in the intercepts, or otherwise have a sufficient basis to provide such contextual testimony.[^152]

  **Original Intercepted Audio.** Where there is enough evidence regarding an intercept, there is no requirement that the original audio be placed before the court for its admission.[^153] The Court can find it unnecessary to have access to the original audio recordings of intercepts when enough evidence surrounding it already exists.[^154] This is also based on the 'best evidence rule' applied at the ICTY, meaning that 'the Trial Chamber will rely on the best evidence available in the circumstances'.[^155] The Trial Chamber in *Blagojević and Jokić* dismissed the Defence's arguments which claimed that 'the Prosecutor should have submitted the original audio recordings ... in order to prove the reliability and authenticity of the intercepts'.[^156] The Trial Chamber established that given the testimonial evidence and the very large amount of documentary evidence, it could not find it necessary to have access to the original intercept.[^157] The Defence further based its arguments on many domestic jurisdictions, who 'view tape recordings with scepticism because they can be tampered with'.[^158] The Trial Chamber responded to this by noting that indeed certain domestic jurisdictions might be sceptical about the reliability of tape recorded material but that, nevertheless, the ICTY's provisions are 'more generous' on the matter.[^159]

  **Witness Testimony.** Judges may have a prima facie basis to admit intercepts and their transcripts where their authenticity and provenance can be demonstrated through witness testimony by the person who intercepted the communication. The witness must be able to testify that they recognise the intercept and its transcripts, and that they are able to identify it as the same one they had recorded.[^160] The Trial Chamber in *Renzaho* found that the tape of an intercepted phone call (recorded by a journalist),[^161] on which the accused allegedly talked of 'extermination', could be admitted. The Defence argued that it was not known how the intercept was made and where it originally came from, and this therefore cast 'doubt and ambiguity as to the authenticity of these tapes'.[^162] In response, the Trial Chamber considered the testimony of the journalist, who testified that he recognised the intercept and its transcript when this was shown to him during examination-in-chief, and he was also able to identify that the intercept in question was the same as the one he had made in 1994. The Court considered that the testimony given was a prima facie basis to admit the tape and the transcripts.[^163]

### Guideline D5. For intercepts to have probative value, it may have to be shown that whoever obtained the admitted intercepts had the technical means to intercept communications.

    PROBATIVE VALUE, TECHNOLOGY

State of the art equipment is not required to intercept communications worthy of probative value. In Mladić, the Defence argued that the ABiH, the SDB, and the Croatian authorities lacked the necessary expertise and technological capacity to intercept VRS communications.[^164] The Prosecution argued that VRS communications were regularly unencrypted and that important communication lines were open and susceptible to interception.[^165] The Trial Chamber found that there was no evidence to support the Defence’s assertion that the ABiH, the SDB, and the Croatian authorities were unable to intercept VRS communications.[^166] To that end, a Defence witness testified that a distinction must be made between professional military grade and amateur grade manufacture devices: military devices are always more sensitive, and need to meet other challenges, like the configuration of the land, weather, and the way in which they are being used. It is not the same as using something in a tent or a dugout, or using something in an office where the temperature is always right, where there is no dust or other influences of that kind. Nevertheless, while the ABiH’s equipment may not have been military grade, it was still able to hear participants that were far away.[^167] As a result, the intercepts did have probative value; nonetheless, the Trial Chamber treated them with caution, and considered whether there was corroboration or further detail provided by other sources of evidence.[^168]

### Guideline D9. The collection of intercepted communication evidence will not constitute a violation of privacy if it is provided for by law, necessary, and proportionate.

    PREJUDICE

Pursuant to Article 69(7) of the [Rome Statute](https://www.icc-cpi.int/resource-library/documents/rs-eng.pdf), evidence obtained in violation of the Court's statutory scheme or international human rights is not admissible. The admission of the evidence would be antithetical to and would seriously damage the integrity of the proceedings. The collection of intercepted communication would not be a violation of the right to privacy if measures impacting the right are lawful, necessary and proportioned. The Appeals Chamber in Bemba et al held that intercepted communication received in the course of normal, administrative activities of the Detention Centre does not violate the right to privacy.[^194] The Appeals Chamber affirmed the Pre-Trial Single Judge’s decision to provide the judicial authorisation necessary for the Prosecution to receive Accused’s non-privileged phone calls from the Detention Centre collected by the Registry, relying on Article 57(3)(a) of the Rome Statute as its legal basis.[^195] The Appeals Chamber added that authorising the transmission of the telephone communications for the purpose of the Prosecution’s investigations into possible offences under Article 70 of the Rome Statute was sufficient factual basis.[^196]

### Guideline D10. Using an independent counsel assigned by a Pre-Trial Judge to review intercepted communication to exclude potential privileged communication does not violate the right to privacy.

    PREJUDICE

Pursuant to Article 69(7) of the [Rome Statute](https://www.icc-cpi.int/resource-library/documents/rs-eng.pdf), to avoid violations of privacy in the case of potential privileged intercepted communications, the Court may appoint an independent counsel tasked with filtering the recordings collected before they are transmitted to the Prosecutor.[^202] The Appeals Chamber in *Bemba et al* held that using an independent counsel to verify intercepted recordings by Dutch authorities did not violate the privacy of the accused.[^203] The measures were taken with the view that independent counsel would 'ensure that recordings of communications protected by privilege as envisaged in the Court's legal framework would not be accessed by the Prosecution.'[^204]
