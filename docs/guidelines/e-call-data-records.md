# E. Call Data Records

### Guideline E1. The relevant data should be extracted from Call Data Records (CDRs) and presented in a readable format as Call Sequence Tables (CSTs).

!!! note "KEYWORDS"
    PROCEDURE, DEFINITION

CDRs are defined as metadata that do not contain the content of any communications, but solely provides information about them, such as the source and destination phone numbers, date and time of phone calls and text messages, the type of communication, the duration of phone calls, the IMEI number[^1] of the handset relevant to the communications, and the cell sectors[^2] engaged at the beginning and end of a call.[^3] However, CDRs are themselves voluminous and, without extraction of the relevant data into a readable format, meaningless.[^4] The Trial Chamber in *Ayyash et al* declined to admit CDRs given that they were voluminous, comprising billions of entries, and unreadable in their raw form as long strings of numbers and symbols.[^5]

Instead, the CDRs should be rendered legible through CSTs. CSTs do not alter the content of the CDRs, but organise and present the relevant information in an intelligible and readable format, and act as an effective filter to separate the relevant evidence relied upon by the parties from the body of CDRs.[^6] The Prosecution in *Ayyash et al* produced a CST presenting a chronological sequence of calls relating to a target telephone number over a specified period of time, comprising relevant CDR information including: the other telephone number in contact with the target telephone number, the time and date of the call, the type of call, the duration, the IMEI number[^7] of the handset used by the target number, and the cell identity and cell sector name of the cell sector used by the target number at the start and end of the call.[^8] In contrast to the CDRs, the Trial Chamber admitted the CSTs into evidence.[^9]

### Guideline E2. The scope of the Prosecution's disclosure obligations includes all CDRs, available CSTs, and related correspondence.

!!! note "KEYWORDS"
    PROCEDURE, DISCLOSURE

**Disclosure of CDRs and CSTs.** The Prosecution is only required to provide the entirety of the CDRs in its custody in the formats it had received them in; they are not required to prepare and disclose all CDRs as harmonised, searchable, or analysed CSTs.[^10] It is only required to disclose CSTs where available, in the format created as part of its analysis of the original raw CDRs. The Single Judge in *Turinabo et al* distinguished the *Karemera et al*[^11] and *MladiÄ‡*[^12] cases where the Prosecution was additionally required to provide 'descriptive indices', as those cases concerned the disclosure of exculpatory material under Rule 68 of the [ICTR](https://unictr.irmct.org/en/documents/rules-procedure-and-evidence) and [ICTY](https://www.icty.org/en/documents/rules-procedure-evidence) Rules of Procedure and Evidence,[^13] whereas the Defence in the instant case had not demonstrated that the material sought was prima facie exculpatory.[^14]

**Disclosure of Related Documents.** Pursuant to Rule 71(B) of the [IRMCT Rules of Procedure and Evidence](https://www.irmct.org/en/documents/rules-procedure-and-evidence), the Prosecutor shall permit the Defence to inspect any books, documents, photographs, and tangible objects in the Prosecutor's custody or control which are material to the preparation of the defence or intended for use at trial.[^15] This establishes the scope of the Prosecutor's disclosure obligations. The Single Judge in *Turinabo et al* held that in addition to the CDRs, the following related documents fell within the scope of the disclosure obligation: correspondence with the Rwandan authorities in relation to the identification and transmission of intercepts, including requests for assistance from the Rwandan authorities, written follow-ups, the responses thereto, and the clearance letter through which the Rwandan authorities consented to the disclosure of the call logs, as these documents could be relevant to the Defence's investigation regarding the origin, nature, or the timing of the call logs and thus assist their preparation.[^16]

**Material Outside Scope of Disclosure Obligation.** Pursuant to Rule 76(A) of the [IRMCT Rules of Procedure and Evidence](https://www.irmct.org/en/documents/rules-procedure-and-evidence), reports, memoranda, or other internal documents prepared by a party in connection with the investigation, preparation, or presentation of the case are not subject to disclosure.[^17] The Single Judge in *Turinabo et al* decided that internal notes and mission reports concerning the intercepted communications were not subject to disclosure where the Defence has not demonstrated that any of the information sought might prima facie be exculpatory.[^18]

### Guideline E3. CDRs and CSTs can be used in relation to other communications evidence or relied upon in their own right.

!!! note "KEYWORDS"
    RELEVANCE

CDRs and CSTs (collectively, 'call data') may be tendered in relation to other communications evidence. For example, they may be tendered together with intercepted communications to provide the metadata associated with those intercepted communications. The call data can be used to corroborate or to discount the other communications evidence. The Trial Chamber in *Bemba et al* found that call data reinforced and confirmed the accuracy of the intercepted communications as they were consistent with each other.[^19] Conversely, the Defence in *Nzabonimpa et al* sought to use call data to discount the reliability of intercepted communications by highlighting discrepancies between the durations of the intercepted communications and the durations of the phone calls indicated in the call data.[^20]

CDRs and CSTs can also be relied upon in their own right to support factual assertions.[^21] For example, call data can demonstrate that a number of target telephones were organised and operated as a closed group in a closed network, which in turn supports charges of co-perpetration or conspiracy.[^22] The Prosecution in *Ayyash et al* relied upon CSTs to show that groups of target telephones were used for the planning and preparation of the alleged attack and related acts.[^23]

### Guideline E4. The reliability of CSTs depends on the authenticity of the underlying CDRs and must be proven through the presentation of expert witnesses.

!!! note "KEYWORDS"
    PROBATIVE VALUE, EXPERT WITNESSES

**Reliability of Underlying CDRs.** CDRs are the primary material on which CSTs are based. Thus, before assessing the probative value of the CSTs, the Court must be satisfied of the reliability of the underlying CDRs.[^24] This may not require the admission into evidence of the CDRs themselves; the coded nature of CDRs means that their content is of no practical utility in its raw form.[^25] Instead, the tendering party should provide contextual evidence on its provenance, including evidence on the creation, storage, and retrieval of the CDRs.[^26] The CDRs themselves may also have inherent indicia of authenticity, such as the corporate watermarks of the telecommunications provider.[^27] For example, some of the CDRs tendered in *Bemba et al* had a 'kpn Group Belgium' watermark.[^28]

**Reliability of CSTs.** The tendering party must then also provide contextual evidence on the CSTs, particularly on how they were produced.[^29] Tendered CSTs must be accompanied by witness statements or testimony about who prepared the CSTs and in what manner.[^30] In *Ayyash et al*, Prosecution analysts described the process of creating the CSTs from the CDRs, including the method used, the peer review process, and the correction of errors in the CSTs; and a Prosecution administrator testified about receiving, storing, and processing raw call data and the design, implementation, maintenance, and repair of a database used for the analysis of the CDRs.[^31]

Where the call data is tendered together with and in relation to intercepted communications, the two categories of evidence are mutually reinforcing and confirm the accuracy of the other.[^32] The Trial Chamber in *Bemba et al* held that it was not necessary for the Prosecution to provide further testimonial evidence on the authenticity of the call data[^33] on top of the evidence already tendered, which included call data with inherent indicia of authenticity, such as the presence of the corporate watermarks of the telecommunications provider or self-identification at the start of intercepted calls;[^34] intercepted communications which matched the corresponding call data;[^35] expert testimony on the origins of the CDRs;[^36] and a case record replete with information confirming the authenticity and chain of custody of the CDRs.[^37]

### Guideline E5. The collection and transfer of CDRs will not constitute a violation of international human rights standards regarding privacy if the collection and transfer are provided for by law, necessary, and proportionate.

!!! note "KEYWORDS"
    PREJUDICE, PRIVACY

Pursuant to Article 69(7) of the [Rome Statute](https://www.icc-cpi.int/Publications/Rome-Statute.pdf), evidence obtained by means of a violation of internationally recognised human rights shall not be admissible if the admission would be antithetical to and would seriously damage the integrity of the proceedings. The collection and transfer of CDRs may infringe the right to privacy, but would not constitute a violation of the right if they are provided for by law, necessary, and proportionate.[^38] This Guideline refers to the collection or transfer of the CDRs for prosecution; CDRs are also routinely and legally generated and retained by telecommunications companies in the normal course of business for billing and systems management purposes.[^39]

**Lawful Basis.** There must be a lawful basis for the collection and transfer of the CDRs. Where this concerns the transmission of a request for cooperation from the Prosecutor to the relevant national authority, the Court will distinguish between two distinct legal issues: first, the authority to transmit the request for cooperation to the relevant national authority, and second, the national authority's subsequent authorisation to carry out the requested collection.[^40] The former is based on the Prosecutor's powers with respect to investigations under Article 54(3) of the [Rome Statute](https://www.icc-cpi.int/Publications/Rome-Statute.pdf) or the Court's authority to make requests to States Parties for cooperation under Article 87(1) of the [Rome Statute](https://www.icc-cpi.int/Publications/Rome-Statute.pdf), whereas the latter is regulated by the domestic law applicable to the national authority.[^41]

Other legal grounds are available. For example, the Appeals Chamber in *Bemba et al* held that the legal basis for the collection of Detention Centre call data was Regulation 174 of the [Regulations of the Registry](https://www.icc-cpi.int/Publications/Regulations-of-the-Registry.pdf) concerning the monitoring of telephone calls of persons detained at the ICC Detention Centre.[^42] The Trial Chamber in *Ayyash et al* held that the legal basis for the transfer of CDRs was the legal framework of cooperation between the STL and the Lebanese authorities under UN Security Council Resolutions [1595](https://www.legal-tools.org/doc/4a0623/) and [1757](https://www.legal-tools.org/doc/c8fb1a/) read with Article 48(1) of the [UN Charter](https://www.un.org/en/about-us/un-charter/full-text), Article 15(1) of the Agreement annexed to [UN Security Council Resolution 1757](https://www.legal-tools.org/doc/c8fb1a/), Rules 14 and 61 of the [STL Rules of Procedure and Evidence](https://www.stl-tsl.org/en/documents/legal-documents/rules-of-procedure-and-evidence), the Memoranda of Understanding between the STL and the Lebanese authorities, and Lebanese law on intercepted communications.[^43]

**Necessity.** The collection of the CDRs must be necessary for the case. It would not be necessary if other reasonable measures are available to obtain the information.[^44] The Trial Chamber in *Bemba et al* held that the collection of the CDRs were necessary as they 'may be of essence for the Prosecution to be able to shed further light on the relevant facts'.[^45] Similarly, the Trial Chamber in *Ayyash et al* held that the transfer of CDRs were necessary as without the CDRs, the Prosecutor could not have identified and established the relevant CSTs to construct the case and file the indictments against the accused persons.[^46]

**Proportionality.** The proportionality of the collection of the CDRs is assessed with reference to a number of factors. In *Bemba et al*, the collection of CDRs was held by the Trial Chamber to be proportionate because they only concerned non-privileged calls and not calls that were protected by attorney-client privilege.[^47] In concluding that the transfer of CDRs was proportionate, the Trial Chamber in *Ayyash et al* considered the gravity of the attack under investigation, the overall unstable security situation, and the fact that the investigation was conducted pursuant to a UN Security Council Resolution under Chapter VII of the UN Charter;[^48] and noted that access to the CDRs was strictly limited to individuals who had professional and ethical obligations of confidentiality, thus minimising the intrusion to any right to privacy.[^49]
