    "title": "Introduction",
    "content": "Digitally Derived Evidence (DDE) has been increasingly used by international criminal courts and tribunals to prosecute perpetrators of international crimes. Advanced digital tools - including aerial photography, mobile devices, video, intercepted communications, amongst others - capture new and vast quantities of data, which can add supplementary and supporting data to existing evidence. For example, while an eyewitness account may provide relevant information regarding an event, a satellite image may unearth information that would be otherwise inaccessible. Furthermore, phone and computer records may provide data relevant to an individual’s activities, or a video may be geo-located and consequently allow investigators to see environmental details that a witness may have forgotten.1 Given the proliferation of digital evidence and increasing reliance on digital evidence for prosecutions, it is possible that in the future, digital evidence may be the primary evidence upon which some convictions are based. While the significant potential of DDE in international criminal law is indisputable, its use raises numerous challenges and legal questions. Therefore, the Guidelines aim to address this legal lacuna by examining the different evidentiary concerns relating to DDE before the international criminal courts and tribunals. The Guidelines are intended to assist practitioners by providing, in a concise manner, the essential elements to be considered before submitting DDE before an international criminal court or tribunal. As they are aimed at legal practitioners, the Guidelines have been designed to be practical and easily accessible whilst also being sufficiently detailed, comprehensive, and substantiated. A subsidiary goal of the Guidelines is knowledge management. The knowledge that has been created should be retained and applied. Recognising that this is a developing area of legal practice, the Guidelines were designed to be flexible enough to accommodate future developments within its existing framework and structure, with an emphasis on maintainability and expandability.

    "title": "Definition of DDE",
    "content": "As DDE is quickly developing and there is no universal definition, the following definitions of DDE are adopted for the Guidelines as they reflect the current understanding: . International Bar Association . ‘Digital and technologically derived evidence, which means evidence taken from and created by digital devices and via technology, such as cameras, satellites and other ‘remote sensing technologies’ […] We distinguish digital evidence, created by digital technology and itself the record or trace of an action or event used for the purpose of proceedings, from the digitization of documents and records for the purpose of storing, organizing and presenting evidence, as for example, with the ICC’s E-Court protocol.’2 . Human Rights Center, UC Berkeley School of Law . ‘Digital evidence is data that is created, manipulated, stored, or communicated by any device, computer or computer system or transmitted over a communication system, that is relevant to the proceeding.’3 .

    "title": "About the Guidelines",
    "content": "Methodology . The Guidelines are based on an in-depth analysis of the jurisprudence of the international criminal courts and tribunals. They draw on the findings in the International Case Summaries, which tracked digital evidence from first introduction until final disposition to gain a deeper understanding of how courts and tribunals had incorporated digital evidence into their existing evidence regimes, as well as the Extrapolations, which extracted the most essential information from the International Case Summaries. These companion documents give practitioners access to the level of detail they require, with the flexibility to expand on the information further. The authors hope this will help legal practitioners navigate the otherwise disorganised jurisprudence. All else being equal, the Guidelines focus on the ICC’s practice and guidance. This recognises its position as the permanent international criminal judicial body, whereas the other tribunals (such as the International Criminal Tribunals for the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda and the International Residual Mechanism, the Special Tribunal for Lebanon, and the Special Court of Sierra Leone) are temporary entities with a more limited mandate. Nonetheless, there may be situations where another court or tribunal has dealt more thoroughly or more recently with a particular type of DDE. In such cases, that court or tribunal was given a more central role in the section. Where appropriate, relevant national jurisprudence was incorporated to provide more depth, detail, or perspective. Structure of the Guidelines . The Guidelines begin by raising general issues of procedure, relevance, probative value, and prejudice common to all DDE. These serve as the starting point for all pieces of DDE, including novel types of DDE which may emerge in the future. Thereafter, the Guidelines address several types of DDE separately in order to take into account the technological and legal particularities of each. Each set of Guidelines adopts the ICC’s three-pronged approach towards evidence4 as the basic structure: relevance, probative value, and prejudice. For comprehensive guidance, further detail surrounding procedure is provided to ensure that these guidelines can be applied as broadly as possible and render the relevant assistance required. Conceptually, these four aspects comprehensively cover the evidentiary issues which might arise. In practice, these are the factors the courts and tribunals use when assessing the admissibility and weight of evidence. Accordingly, reliability will be covered as an element of probative value; other principles of international law, such as the right to privacy, will be discussed as factors relevant to prejudice. | International Bar Association, Evidence Matters in ICC Trials (August 2016) 20. &#8617; . | International Bar Association, Evidence Matters in ICC Trials (August 2016) 19. &#8617; . | Alexa Koenig and others, Digital Fingerprints: Using Electronic Evidence to Advance Prosecutions at the International Criminal Court (Human Rights Center, UC Berkeley School of Law 2014) fn 2, citing Stephen Mason, International Electronic Evidence (British Institute of International and Comparative Law 2008). &#8617; . | Prosecutor v Bemba (Decision on the admission into evidence of items deferred in the Chamber’s “Decision on the Prosecution’s Application for Admission of Materials into Evidence Pursuant to Article 64(9) of the Rome Statute” (ICC-01/05-01/08-2299)) ICC-01/05-01/08 (27 June 2013) [9]. &#8617; . | .
