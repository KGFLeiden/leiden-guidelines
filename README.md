## Notes for Content Editors

The content pages are formatted with the help of Markdown. See this [cheat sheet](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/) for a quick introduction to the most frequently used elements.

The most important elements for our purposes are:
- [Headings](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/#headings)
- [Emphasis](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/#emphasis) (bold/italics)
- [Footnotes](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/#footnotes)
- [Links](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/#links)

Please apply the following conventions:
- Use Heading 3 (###) for the Guidelines themselves: `### Guideline A1. Videos...`

- Insert the following syntax in a line immediately after keywords: `{: .label }`. For example,
```
Keywords: relevance, probative value
{: .label }
```

- Italicise sub-headings within the commentary, followed by a full stop: `*Time Limits*. Pursuant to ...`
